### Polyfill

While the library does run on most modern browsers, it does not work on IE11.

The library requires `Math.trunc`, `Math.sign`, and `Array.prototype.includes`. These can be added with the Polyfill below:
```
<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=Math.trunc%2CMath.sign%2CArray.prototype.includes"></script>
```

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank:

* Guru Sahib, who inspires us into Sikhi.

* Pal Singh Purewal, who explained various concepts in the Bikrami and Nanakshahi Calendars to me and answered my various technical and historical questions.

* E. M. Reingold and N. Dershowitz for their Calendrical Calculations book and Calendrica program code, which serves as the base for this library.

* My father, Jasjit Singh, whose curiosity in the Nanakshahi and Bikrami calendar systems inspired me find answers to his technical questions.

## Contributing

We're happy to accept suggestions and pull requests!

To get started, clone this repo and run `npm install` inside this directory. 

This repository follows the **Airbnb's Javascript Style Guide**, with a few minor modifications. Notably, spaces should be included inside parentheses and brackets (weird, right!). An ESLint file is provided,
and your code will automatically be checked on-commit for style.
It is recommended to install an ESLint plugin for your editor (VS Code's `ESLint` plugin works out of the box), so you can receive
linter suggestions as you type.

When writing commit messages, please follow the **[seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)**. 
Markdown and HTML JSDoc documentation is generated automatically, on commit,
however if you'd like to preview any changes to documentation, `npm run build-docs` will
update `README.md`. `README.md` should *not* be edited, instead apply modifications to `README.hbs`.

The general workflow for contributing:

- Fork/create a new branch.
- Write or update existing tests with expected results
- Implement functions/changes
- Add JSDoc function documentation and examples.
- Create a pull request with the changes.
