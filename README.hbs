## Contributing

We're happy to accept suggestions and pull requests!

To get started, clone this repo and run `npm install` inside this directory. 

This repository follows the **Airbnb's Javascript Style Guide**, with a few minor modifications. Notably, spaces should be included inside parentheses and brackets (weird, right!). An ESLint file is provided,
and your code will automatically be checked on-commit for style.
It is recommended to install an ESLint plugin for your editor (VS Code's `ESLint` plugin works out of the box), so you can receive
linter suggestions as you type.

When writing commit messages, please follow the **[seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)**. 
Markdown and HTML JSDoc documentation is generated automatically, on commit,
however if you'd like to preview any changes to documentation, `npm run build-docs` will
update `README.md` and the files in `docs/`. `README.md` should *not* be edited, instead
apply modifications to `README.hbs`.

The general workflow for contributing:

- Fork/create a new branch.
- Write or update existing tests with expected results
- Implement functions/changes
- Add JSDoc function documentation and examples.
- Run tests with `npm test` and ensure they all pass. Testing is done with the `mocha` testing framework.
- Create a pull request with the changes.
